**Question:** Add at least 3 Project features

**Answer:** The project named “Donation Campaign” facilitates users to look through 12 donation campaigns of four categories. The main features of the project are given below.

- **Click to View Campaign Details:** The project allows users to view the details of the particular donation campaign by clicking any of the 12 cards in the home page. 
- **Search by Categories:** The project allows users to search by category name in the search box on the banner. There are four categories of donations – “Health”, “Food”, “Education” and “Clothing”. The user has to properly enter the category name to avail this feature. The search keywords are case sensitive. If the user enters any name other then the four particular categories, a toast will be shown notifying the user that the category name has not been entered properly.
- **Updated Donation List:** The user can see all the donations made by going to the “Donation” page. If the number of donations is more than four, the user would have to press the “See All” button at the bottom to see all the donations made. 
- **Current Statistics:** The project can show the current stat of donation made in the “Statistics” page through a pie chart. The user can see the percentage of donation made compared to total donation.
